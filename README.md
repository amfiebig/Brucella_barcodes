Codes used to analyze population dynamics of barcoded B. abortus strains in the course of infection

In this repository are resources used to assess strain level population dynamics during infection using a pool strains barcodes with transposons.  The manuscript corresponding to this work can be found on BioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.12.380766v1.

In this repository you will find: 
- the R scripts written for the analysis (S1-S6), 
- a text document overviewing the files needed and generated by each set of codes.  
- the raw data, the sample_names.txt, and the mapping pool file used for this analysis.  

To adapt this analysis for your purposes, you will need the following files in your working directory as a starting point:
(1) a “raw_data” folder containing the .counts and .codes files from MultiCodes.pl, 
(2) the pool file from mapping if you want to look at overlap (in S3), and 
(3) a tab delimited text file with sample names that match the file names on the .counts documents and also any revised or simpler name you’d like to give your samples in the analysis (see attached examples).  

In the code, I refer to the lines in my ‘sample_names.txt’ file to read in different sets of samples.  You will have to manually adjust that to call groups of samples according to your desires.

I typically run the codes line by line.  I don’t have them set up as a scripts.
